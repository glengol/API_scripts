# Scripts
General scripts for customers

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that leverage various APIs to automate tasks and operations. The scripts interact with APIs like Firefly, GitHub, AWS, and Azure to perform bulk operations, generate reports, and manage resources programmatically.

## Overview

These scripts use API integrations to:
- Bulk codify cloud resources (AWS and Azure) into Terraform
- Analyze and report on cloud snapshots and resources
- Automate workspace creation from repository structures
- Query and filter assets based on governance policies
- Generate mappings and reports from API data

Each script is self-contained and can be configured with API credentials and parameters as needed.
